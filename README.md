# Find_Quiz_Average
Create a data file named gradesIn.txt containing quiz scores for approximately five students. 
Each student should have four quiz scores recorded using the double data type.
Your program should first read the four quiz scores from the file, 
then call a value-returning function that calculates the average after dropping the lowest score. 
This function must accept four double parameters and return the average of the three highest scores.

The output should be displayed on both the console and an output file. Name the output file as gradesOut.txt.
The output must include all the original data from the input file and an additional column showing each studentâ€™s quiz average.
